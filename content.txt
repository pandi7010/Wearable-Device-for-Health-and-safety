Abstract:
This paper presents the design and development of a dual-function wearable device, the Smart Wearable Safelet, aimed 
at providing both health monitoring and personal safety features. The device integrates sensors to monitor vital signs 
such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen levels while providing real-time emergency alerts to authorities 
in the event of health or safety emergencies. Additionally, the wearable features a GPS module for real-time geolocation 
tracking and a GSM module to send alerts to the nearest police station or hospital. This paper discusses the system's 
architecture, hardware components, software implementation, and real-world applications.

1. Introduction
The increasing demand for integrated healthcare and safety solutions has led to the development of wearable 
technologies that can perform dual functions. In rural areas of Tamil Nadu, India, challenges such as a lack of real-time 
health monitoring and personal safety issues persist. This paper proposes a wearable device called Safelet, designed to 
provide continuous health monitoring and real-time geolocation tracking for emergency alerts. Safelet offers an 
affordable and reliable solution to bridge the gap between health care and personal safety.
2. Problem Statement
There is a significant gap in healthcare and personal safety, particularly in rural areas. Lack of timely emergency 
response and real-time health monitoring often leads to delayed diagnoses and inadequate management of chronic 
illnesses. Additionally, incidents of harassment and personal safety concerns remain a serious issue. Addressing both 
these needs, this device ensures real-time health monitoring and sends location-based alerts to relevant authorities.
3. Proposed System
The proposed system integrates multiple sensors and modules into a wearable band that offers the following 
functionalities:
• Health Monitoring: Real-time tracking of vital signs (heart rate, temperature, oxygen levels).
• Personal Safety: Emergency buttons to alert authorities with the user's geolocation in cases of personal safety 
risks.
• Communication: The system uses GSM for sending SMS alerts and GPS for tracking location.
3.1 Hardware Components
• Microcontroller: Arduino Nano
• Sensors:
➢ Heartbeat sensor (KY-039)
➢ Temperature sensor (LM35)
➢ Pulse Oximeter sensor (MAX30100)
• GPS Module: Neo-6M for location tracking
• GSM Module: SIM800L for emergency SMS alerts
• Buttons: Three buttons for sending alerts based on the emergency type
• Power Supply: Rechargeable battery
3.2 Software Implementation
• The device is programmed using Arduino IDE.
➢ Sensor Data: Sensors collect real-time data which is processed by the microcontroller.
➢ GPS Data: Geolocation is obtained through the GPS module and is included in SMS alerts sent during 
emergencies.
➢ Emergency Alerts: Pressing the Red or Green button triggers the GSM module to send an alert message 
containing the user’s GPS coordinates to the nearest police station or hospital.
4. System Architecture
The system's architecture is designed around the interaction between the sensors, GPS, and GSM modules, all controlled 
by the Arduino Nano microcontroller. The wearable device continuously monitors the user's vital signs and waits for 
emergency button presses. When an emergency is detected, the system:
1. Activates the corresponding emergency button (Safety or Health).
2. Retrieves the GPS coordinates of the user.
3. Sends an SMS alert to predefined emergency contacts (police for safety, hospital for health emergencies).
5. Circuit Design and Integration
The design involves connecting the various sensors and modules to the microcontroller. The heartbeat sensor, 
temperature sensor, and pulse oximeter are connected to the analog pins of the Arduino Nano, while the GPS and GSM 
modules use serial communication. The buttons and buzzer are controlled by the digital pins.
5.1 Schematic Diagram
The circuit design connects the sensors, GPS, GSM, and buttons in a compact and efficient manner to ensure low power 
consumption and ease of integration.
6. Results and Testing
The wearable device was tested in both laboratory and real-world scenarios. It successfully monitored the user’s heart 
rate, temperature, and oxygen levels. During safety and health emergencies, pressing the appropriate button triggered 
the GSM module to send an SMS alert with the user’s location to the relevant authorities. The system proved to be 
effective in providing timely alerts and monitoring health metrics in real-time.
7. Benefits
➢ Continuous Monitoring: Offers real-time health data monitoring for chronic disease management.
➢ Emergency Response: Instant location-based alerts ensure timely response during emergencies.
➢ Wearable Design: Skin-friendly materials make it suitable for long-term use.
➢ Broad Applicability: Can be used in rural areas where real-time monitoring is crucial.
8. Feasibility and Challenges
➢ Battery Life: Optimized to last up to a full day with intermittent use.
➢ Comfort and Fit: Designed for comfort with a skin-friendly band, but extended wear may require further 
ergonomic adjustments.
➢ Durability: The device is resistant to environmental factors like dust and water.
9. Conclusion
This paper presents a novel dual-function wearable device that combines health monitoring with personal safety features. 
The Safelet demonstrates the potential to address healthcare and safety challenges in underserved areas, offering a 
reliable and scalable solution. Further improvements in power management, sensor calibration, and ergonomic design 
will enhance its usability and long-term adoption.
10. Future Work
➢ Cloud Integration: Adding cloud storage for continuous data monitoring by healthcare providers.
➢ Extended Battery Life: Optimizing power consumption for longer device life.
➢ Advanced Analytics: Utilizing AI to predict health emergencies before they occur.
